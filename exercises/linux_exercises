 Students will reject the Unix philosophy unless they understand its power. Thus, it's best to challenge students to complete useful tasks for which Unix has a comparative advantage, such as:

* Find the five folders in a given directory consuming the most space.
* Report duplicate MP3s (by file contents, not file name) on a computer.
* Take a list of names whose first and last names have been lower-cased, and properly recapitalize them.
* Find all words in English that have x as their second letter, and n as their second-to-last.
* Directly route your microphone input over the network to another computer's speaker.
* Replace all spaces in a filename with underscore for a given directory.
* Report the last ten errant accesses to the web server coming from a specific IP address.
